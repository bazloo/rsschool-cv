## About me

Hello! My name is Roman Panchenko, and I'm a junior node.js developer!
I've started to learn web-development in September of 2020 just for my own fun, 
but when I first had tried JS it was so excited for me, that I decided to
get more efficient in this unique programming language and do coding for a living!
As a result, fortune had given me she's kiss, and I've got my first job in IT as a
junior node.js developer.

My goals on this RSSchool JS-frontend course are, and actually why I'm participating:

1. To repeat the basics of JS
2. Build-up my knowledge of programming patterns
3. Make a great project using native JS (I hope, we'll do this)
4. Have fun with the Front-end part

### Technology's stack

* __HTML, CSS, Bootstrap__
* __JavaScript__
* __Node.js__
* __React & Redux__

#### Little example of my code
```
let sayHi = () => 'hello there!'
sayHi() // will return 'hello there!'
```
